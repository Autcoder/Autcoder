## Hi there 👋

### Hi there, it's me Florian. A random guy coding his way.  

```diff
+ Currently working on:
```
- 🧬 **Evolution Simulation** – A simple program that simulates evolution over time.
- 🖥️ **Language Installer** – Install programming languages without remembering commands.
- 🧮 **Terminal Calculator** – A lightweight math tool for quick calculations.

(Also, I'm pretty good at procrastinating 😆)
