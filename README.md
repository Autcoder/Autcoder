## Hi there 👋

### Hi, it's me Florian. A random guy on Github coding his way.  

```diff
+ Currently working on: A random Project
```
- 🧬 **Evolution Simulation** – A simple program that simulates evolution over time.
- 🖥️ **Language Installer** – Install programming languages without remembering commands.
- 🧮 **Terminal Calculator** – A terminal based math tool for quick calculations or pretty much anything.

(Also, I'm pretty good at procrastinating 😆)
